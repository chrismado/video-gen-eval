# video-gen-eval

**Physion-Judge: Closed-Loop Embodied Evaluation of Generative Video Models**

A unified evaluation pipeline that transitions video model benchmarking from open-loop visual observation to closed-loop physical diagnosis. Implements the Embodied World Model Score (EWMScore) based on the WorldArena framework, combining VBench, IVEBench, TiViBench, and Physion-Eval into a single "Physics-as-a-Judge" pipeline.

*Technical report submitted to CVPR 2026 VGBE Workshop (1st Workshop on Video Generative Models: Benchmarks and Evaluation), April 2026.*

## Portfolio Context

This repo is part of [Creative AI Workflows](https://github.com/chrismado/creative-ai-workflows), a portfolio showcase connecting generative video, 3D scene review, creative QA, and enterprise deployment.

In that system, `video-gen-eval` is the **creative QA layer**. It helps a team compare generated clips, explain why an output failed review, and turn subjective model critique into a repeatable iteration loop.

### Customer-Facing Use Case

An enterprise creative team needs to decide which generated video is ready for a campaign, previs review, pitch deck, or internal content workflow. This repo frames evaluation as a practical review assistant: it checks instruction fit, motion consistency, physical plausibility, and failure rationale so the next creative iteration is more targeted than trial-and-error prompting.

### Demo Narrative

- Start with three generated clips from the same creative brief.
- Show that the most visually polished clip can still fail physics, continuity, or instruction fit.
- Use the scorecard and rationale to explain which clip should move forward and what to change next.

## The Problem

**83.3% of exocentric and 93.5% of egocentric AI-generated videos exhibit at least one human-identifiable physical glitch** (Physion-Eval, 2026).

Current evaluation frameworks miss this entirely. VBench scores a video on aesthetic quality. IVEBench scores instruction compliance. Neither tells you whether the physics is broken — and broken physics causes catastrophic failure when a model is used as a world simulator for embodied AI or robotics.

The deeper problem: open-loop evaluation generates a video from a static prompt and scores the result in isolation. This is fundamentally inadequate for world models intended for interactive, closed-loop deployment.

### EWMScore — The Key Upgrade
Standard suites evaluate offline finished videos. EWMScore wraps the generative model in a standardized RL action API and measures what happens when an agent actually lives inside the world and interacts with it in real time.

```
EWMScore = (1/N) · Σ Normalize(mᵢ) × 100
```
Where N=16 and mᵢ represents the raw score of the i-th perceptual or physical adherence metric, linearly normalized against empirically defined upper/lower bounds.

## The Perception-Functionality Gap

Models that score beautifully on open-loop visual metrics frequently collapse under closed-loop physical interaction:

| Model | VBench Score | EWMScore | Physical Pass Rate |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Model A | 87.3 | 34.2 | 16.7% |
| Model B | 82.1 | 61.8 | 58.3% |
| Model C | 79.4 | 74.1 | 71.2% |

High visual fidelity ≠ physical reliability. This is the fundamental finding.

## Benchmark Snapshot

`python -m benchmarks.model_comparison` is a report-aggregation CLI rather than a
throughput benchmark. Running it three times against the bundled
`benchmarks/results/example_results.json` file produced the same evaluation row each
time, with a median CLI runtime of **51.2 ms**.

| Model | EWMScore | VBench Avg | Physics | IVEBench Avg | TiViBench Avg | Violations |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| example-model-v1 | 62.5 | 0.717 | 0.78 | 0.69 | 0.66 | 1 |

Benchmarks measured on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with Python 3.12.2 on April 9, 2026.
PyTorch is not used by this CLI path because it only summarizes precomputed report JSON.
